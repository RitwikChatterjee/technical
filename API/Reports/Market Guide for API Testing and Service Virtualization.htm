                           <li>The need for API testing and service virtualization is becoming increasingly important
                              as IT organizations develop bimodal capability to support mobile, digital business
                              transformation initiatives and the Internet of Things (IoT).
                           </li>
                           <li>The rapid adoption of agile and SOA-based solutions to support business agility demands
                              that development and test organizations change approaches and tools to drive a broader,
                              more accurate view of complex system quality.
                           </li>
                           <li>Service virtualization enables earlier, continuous, complete and parallel development
                              and testing of software in a highly complex, heterogeneous and distributed environment.
                              It can also reduce overall test lab costs.
                           </li>
                           <li>The market for testing and service virtualization is currently sized around US$200
                              million and growing at a CAGR of 12%. Growth is steady as businesses open up and share
                              services internally and with partners.

                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li>Evaluate your current software development and delivery processes, identifying the
                              biggest issues and challenges from process and skills perspectives. This will lead
                              toward an effective solution and guide the required skills to develop or acquire.
                           </li>
                           <li>Involve roles from different functions and share ownership across several competency
                              leaders in adopting technologies and tools. This will help identify key obstacles
                              to overcome and provide work-arounds so the project can move forward smoothly.
                           </li>
                           <li>Develop a plan for acquiring technologies and tools that will enable much earlier
                              testing in the development life cycle, continuous integration and faster release processes.
                           </li>
                           <li>Adopt a long-term tooling strategy that factors in business needs and requirements,
                              existing processes, tool requirements, benefits, costs, expertise and training.

                        <p>The application programming interface (API) testing and service virtualization market
                           is a subset of the overall software testing tools market. It consists of vendors offering
                           solutions for automating the testing functionality and/or performance for APIs or
                           Web services and solutions, to simulate or "virtualize" interdependent components.
                           Rather than driving the user interface as most automation tools do, these tools test
                           the system-to-system interactions driving the APIs and services. Virtualization is
                           a technique that expands on the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/" target="_blank">object mocking</a>&nbsp;to simulate the behavior of services by adding capabilities such as timing responses,
                           error handling and the ability to simulate unavailable resources. This reduces system
                           costs and allows a deeper set of tests to be run by playing with service parameters.
                        </p>
                        <p>Service virtualization was first introduced to the market by ITKO (acquired by CA
                           Technologies) in 2007, and early entrants have been the most dominant in the market.

                        <p>The shift to more service-oriented architectures that heavily rely on dependent services,
                           and the rapid adoption of agile software development practices make it increasingly
                           important to look beyond traditional functionality and performance testing, as well
                           as drive a need for testing earlier and more frequently. By eliminating constraints
                           in today's highly complex composite applications, which are developed using heterogeneous
                           technologies and managed and owned by distributed teams, many software development
                           life cycle activities can happen earlier and become parallel again. Each component
                           owned by a team can be tested individually in the context of its real environment,
                           instead of waiting for issues to surface later during integration, when they are costlier
                           to fix. In testing APIs or services, team members can use a more flexible alternative
                           to developing and maintaining method stubs or mock objects that act as substitutes
                           for dependent resources. Service virtualization further extends this concept by productizing
                           the creation of stubbing frameworks to model the behavior of complex, interdependent
                           services.
                        </p>
                        <p>When organizations shift toward Web-scale architectures, which are based upon microservices,
                           businesses become more responsive. However, the challenge here is the dependent underlying
                           applications and/or services' availability, which is highly important during integration
                           in parts as well as end-to-end testing of business processes as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p>Service virtualization enables development and QA teams to simulate and model the
                           behavior of complex, interdependent unavailable and/or limited services, thus removing
                           constraints in needing to access components, databases, mainframes and so on. Intelligent
                           virtual services can be used all the way from implementation to delivery, and provide
                           significantly more value than simplistic stubs whose use is mainly limited to unit
                           tests in early development. API tests validate the correct behavior of a service interface
                           by generating requests and inspecting the corresponding responses. Simultaneously,
                           virtual services receive these requests, emulate the real-world service's behavior
                           and provide the appropriate responses on any number of supported protocols, in a variety
                           of message formats. Service virtualization shifts the ability to test applications
                           earlier in their development life cycle, enabling integration and release processes
                           to happen faster, with higher quality and less risk. It also enables other nonfunctional
                           testing, such as performance testing against a simulated connection or load testing
                           that simulates multiple connections.
                        </p>
                        <p>A simple approach of mocking a service can aid a developer with unit testing, but
                           it does not scale to support the entire team. Mocking functions are typically very
                           context-specific, simulating a specific behavioral response to fulfill a certain development
                           need at a certain time (for example, resolving a missing dependency). Developing a
                           realistic simulation to support more test cases is complicated and can quickly become
                           a major development and maintenance effort, diverting time from developing application
                           functionality. In addition, no infrastructure exists to support sharing these stubs
                           across the team. Virtualized services, however, allow team members to emulate environments
                           and make their behavior available to the entire team. They can be deployed throughout
                           the entire production cycle, consistently delivering the same behavior and functionality
                           for anyone who wants to use them at any time. Virtual components that are part of
                           a projectwide test environment eliminate the need for individual developers to write
                           and rewrite their own mocks and stubs, saving time and effort for all team members.
                           From a testing perspective, the behavior of individual classes can be tested with
                           object mocking, whereas the behavior of entire network back-end services can be simulated
                           and tested with service virtualization. As a consequence, mocking is best-suited for
                           unit tests while service virtualization is better for integration and performance
                           tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>Virtual services can be created and maintained in a number of different ways. One
                           common way is capturing live traffic by listening to the transactions between the
                           various participating systems. Calls and responses between servers, integration layers
                           and other components are intercepted and recorded on the protocol level — for example,
                           HTTP, SOAP, JMS, JDBC, etc. A model of the service behavior can also be created from
                           historical data recorded in a file — for example, a WSDL definition, a day's history
                           of server logs or a spreadsheet of data. User modeling, or manual creation of the
                           conversation between the service components, represents yet another option where the
                           virtualized service is created from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <p>Established commercial vendors offer both service/API testing and service virtualization
                           capabilities. The natural synergy between automating API tests and service virtualization
                           enables the tools to share protocol definitions and datasets between virtual services
                           and automated service tests. The same test suites can be used to validate both production
                           and virtual components.
                        </p>
                        <p>On top of the commercial offerings are several open-source tools that can be considered
                           for testing API services and building service virtualization quickly. These tools
                           have limited features but are worth evaluating for fitness of project purpose and
                           requirements.

                        <p>Automating service and API testing and adopting service virtualization technology
                           are not just about tooling; they require development and QA teams to have a detailed
                           understanding of the underlying SOA principles and technologies. The technical nature
                           of the communication protocols, heavy reliance on tools and lack of user-friendly
                           interfaces mean that the traditional approach to QA is inappropriate and, therefore,
                           a transformation of QA practices will be needed to maintain quality of service. QA
                           teams specifically need to acquire new skills on new technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>Before adopting service virtualization technology, consider:</p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li>The current state of your software development and delivery processes — that is, identify
                              the biggest challenges or pain points that are costing the organization:
                              <ul class="bullets_yes">
                                 <li>Test cycle delays due to unavailability of components connected to applications under
                                    test, affecting time to market
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Access to dependent systems such as mainframe, services, third-party applications,
                                    partner software and so on
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Financially, in terms of costs associated with provisioning test environments</li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                           <li>The cost to implement a service virtualization solution, including:
                              <ul class="bullets_yes">
                                 <li>Product licenses — an open-source advantage</li>
                                 <li>Hardware cost to host the solution versus cost of hardware to replicate production</li>
                                 <li>Learning curve</li>
                                 <li>Training — open source relies on community</li>
                                 <li>Any associated implementation costs</li>
                              </ul>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The above will help develop the business case. Note, however, that service virtualization
                           is just one side of the virtualization equation and forms part of continuous testing
                           process. Virtualization of test data, network and automation of lab environments must
                           not be taken for granted. Service virtualization can work without these, but the ROI
                           will be compromised.
                        </p>
                        <p>Prior to choosing tools, put in place correct planning and processes. Adopt a long-term
                           tool strategy that factors in existing processes, tool requirements, benefits, costs,
                           expertise and training. Consider carrying out a proof of concept to assess the potential
                           benefits.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adoption of these technologies and tools will be most effective and successful when
                           the team can participate and ownership is shared across several competency leaders.
                           Organizations need to consider which roles will be involved in various ways, and this
                           includes architects, development leads, QA leads and the operations lead. This will
                           help identify obstacles to overcome and provide work-arounds so the project can move
                           forward smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p>We expect that the prevalence of mobile and cloud computing, the emergence of digital
                           business and the IoT will continue to drive adoption of service/API testing and service
                           virtualization solutions. The IoT, in particular, will evolve and create innovation
                           in these products, and vendors will have to broaden their support for IoT protocols
                           as they become adopted in consumer-facing IT solutions.
